Return two digit month
Use this example to extract the single digit month elements from todayâ€™s date and then build a string datatype to display a two digit month the different date elements.

First, create a new derived user field set to the current date:

    Derived Fields

        ZZZCurrentDate is a DerivedField
            type is Date
            return current date
Next, create a derived user field to extract the month. This will return a single digit.

    Derived Fields

        ZZZCurrentMonth is a DerivedField
            type is Date
            return (ZZZCurrentDate month)
Then create another derived user field to determine if the month is double digit or single digit. If it is a single digit, add a zero (0) to the front.

ZZZMonthTwoChar is a DerivedField
            type is Alpha size 2
            if (ZZZMonth size <  2)
                return ("0" + ZZZMonth)
            else
                return (ZZZMonth)
