                ZZZQuarter = 1
            else
                if (ZZZMyDate month >= 4
                and   ZZZMyDate month <= 6)
                    ZZZQuarter = 2

                    if (ZZZMyDate month >= 7
                    and   ZZZMyDate month <= 9)
                        ZZZQuarter = 3
